# Run-Length-Encoding-and-Decoding
Run-length encoding ( RLE) is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs. I am implementing this using python. One of the easiest algorithms to implement. Just doing it for learning purpose.<br>
